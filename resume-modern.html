            <p>Matthew is a rockstar with many different talents - when he says he can do engineering, product and UX, he is right on target! We were lucky to have Matthew guide Taro engineering while we took an MVP and built it into a real product. Matthew is great at getting things done, but he is also great at setting up processes, ensure quality and compliance as well as building the team out. As a startup, what we really appreciated was that he made himself available at any time of the day or night to fix issues and resolve any problems and took responsibility of the entire infrastructure. I would hire Matthew again in a heartbeat.

            <p>Matthew is a rarity among front-end developers. He a unique blend of hard-working, very skilled technically, and also has a sound design sense. He is particularly strong with leading-edge code practice and new UX principles and theory. This makes him an ideal candidate for companies with ambitious plans who iterate quickly on concepts. I think my favorite part about Matthew is his attitude. He is always quick to find ways to make the best design possible, even if it means substantial technical work or learning something new. I have often heard PM&#39;s and designers say he is &quot;delightful&quot; to work with. I echo those sentiments. His leadership and talents will be a great addition to any team.

            </p>

            <p>Matthew is a talented front-end engineer. While technical, he&#39;s also very much customer focused. He&#39;s a strong proponent of clean, tested code at all tiers. In these exciting times in front-end engineering, Matthew is always on top of the latest and greatest technologies. You know... the kinds that improve product quality, increase developer productivity, and speed up delivery. On top of all this, Matthew has a positive and optimistic attitude, an entrepreneurial sprit, and is just a great guy to work with.

              <strong>Jimmie Fulton, Principle Software Engineer at Boku, Inc.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>I hired Matthew while at Xoom and would hire him again in a heartbeat: he is solid technically, is both able to &quot;up level&quot; and communicate clearly with executives and build a solid report with highly back-end engineers to get the details of an implementation finalized. He is also very much eager to share his findings and evangelize the &quot;right way&quot; to get things done across an organization, while keeping in mind project timelines and overall business goals. Last but not least, Matthew has a great sense of humor and is fun to work with. Anyone would be lucky to have Matthew in their organization!
 -
              <strong>Frederic Billou, Director of Product at Xoom, Inc.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Matthew not only gets things done, but will think about how they can be done better. One of the pleasures of working with Matthew is that he has an contagious enthusiasm for improving the product, the team, and the process. And he&#39;ll make sure everyone is on-board and excited about it too. Matthew is effective and a pleasure to work with.
 -
              <strong>Anne Stern, QA Manager at Xoom, Inc.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Matthew&#39;s understanding of user-centered design, usability, user research, and product management make him a great person to work with. He is strong-willed and will fight hard for a solution that best serves the user. If a UI Designer is a champion for the user, then Matthew is a champion for designers. It was invaluable to have someone on the development side who can see the whole picture. I would highly recommend Matthew for leadership positions in the future.

              <strong>Brian Dils, Sr. UX Designer at Logitech, Inc.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>Matthew is one of the most enthusiastic and capable people I have ever met. He created and supported many of the tools that allowed me to do my job. His tremendous amount of technical knowledge along with his ability to effectively create unique solutions and communicate along many different groups makes him a huge asset to any team.
